# ManimSort
---
This project aims to visualize the procedure of sorting algorithms (and other algorithms soon) via animations created with [Manim](https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim).

## Why ManimSort?
<p>
This project arises from the idea of implementing and fully understand how sort (and others) algorithms work. Each directory in this repository is dedicated for an specific
algorithm, and holds two files: <span style = "color:Violet">sort.py</span> and <span style = "color:Violet">anim.py</span> (so far this project is only implemented in Python code).
</p>
<p>
<span style = "color:Violet">sort.py</span> scripts contains the respectively implementation of the algorithm in Python code and <span style = "color:Violet">anim.py</span> the code from which the animations are made.
